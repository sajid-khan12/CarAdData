# CarAdData

This will have all my findings and all my analysis 

Questions to Answer 
1.	How does price vary across cities and seller types?
2.	What are the most advertised vehicle makes/models?
3.	Do longer ad titles correlate with higher prices?
4.	Are specific keywords in ad titles (e.g., "urgent", "new") linked to price changes?
5.	How does price distribution differ between cities?
